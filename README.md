 C Programming Practice – BSc. CSIT

These are the C programming problems I solved during my **first 1.5 years of Bachelors in CSIT
The repository includes a wide range of programs, from basic to advanced, covering core concepts of the C language.


 Topics Covered

* Basics: Input/Output, operators, conditionals, loops
* Arrays & Strings: Searching, sorting, string operations
* Functions & Recursion: Factorial, Fibonacci, GCD/LCM, Tower of Hanoi, N-Queens
* Pointers & Dynamic Memory: Pointer arithmetic, dynamic arrays, matrices, stack using pointers
* Data Structures in C: Linked lists, stacks, queues, polynomial addition, priority queue
* File Handling: Reading/writing files, word/line count, merging files, student/employee record management
* Algorithms: Quicksort, Merge sort, Kadane’s Algorithm, pattern matching


File Naming Convention

Each program is saved in a separate file with a descriptive name:

* `dynamic_array_min_max.c` → Find max & min using dynamic memory
* `tower_of_hanoi.c` → Tower of Hanoi using recursion
* `linked_list_basic.c` → Linked list with insert, delete, display
* `quicksort.c` → Quicksort algorithm
* `file_word_count.c` → Count words, lines, characters in a file
* *(and many more…)*

 
 Purpose

* Strengthen my problem-solving skills in C
* Build a strong foundation for data structures & algorithms
* Practice file handling, pointers, recursion, and dynamic memory
* Prepare for exams, labs, and projects



 Note

These programs were written during my first 1.5 years of BSc. CSIT. They may not be the most optimized solutions, but they reflect my learning journey.
